# nz-earthquake-history-web
This project builds an interactive web-based visualization of New Zealand’s earthquake history using real data. It displays key seismic attributes including location, magnitude, depth, and time of occurrence. The goal is to help users explore spatial and temporal earthquake patterns through an intuitive and engaging interface.
